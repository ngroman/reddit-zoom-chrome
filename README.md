# Reddit Zoom for Chrome
A Google Chrome extension that adds buttons to quickly scroll past entire blocks of comments on Reddit without collapsing them.

Collapsing works fine until you leave the page and come back. Then your position is totally lost. This extension adds a small arrow button next to blocks of comments that causes you to scroll past that block.
